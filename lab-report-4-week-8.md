1. Snippet1

I think a small code change will make the program work for snippet 1. I can simply add an if statement to check if there is a  \` mark prior to the open bracket. And, if there is one, the currentIndex should directly jump to the index of charactor after the following close paratheses.


2. Snippet2

I donâ€™t think a small code change would work in this case, because I need to match the open paratheses with correct closing paratheses and this step need to consider many different cases. 


3. Snippet3

I think I can fix this by simply adding an if statement. So if there is a blank link in [] or (), currIndex should directly jump to next open bracket.
