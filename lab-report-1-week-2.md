# Lab Report 1

In Lab 1 you will set up VS code and learn how to do remote connection.

## 1. Set up VS Code ##

* Follow the instructoin and download VS Code from [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com).
* After installed you should see the page below when you open it.

## 2. Remotely Connecting ##

* In VS Code, open terminal and run the command:
    `$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
    
* Type yes if you get a message like this:
    
    `â¤‡ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
    The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`
    
* Press enter, and then give your password. Now you successfully connect to another computer in the terminal.

## 3. Trying Some Commands ##

* Try commands in terminal. For example: 

        ls - show list
        cd - change directory 
        pwd - print working directories

## 4. Moving Files with `scp` ##
* Use the command `scp` to copy a file from your computer to a remote computer.
* Remember always run it from the client(your computer).

## 5. Setting an SSH Key ##
* Use SSH key to avoid typing the password repeatedly every time you log in. 
* First, run the command `ssh-keygen` which creates two files - public key and private key on your computer. (do not add a passphrase for this step)
* Second, copy the public key to the server computer. 
    
    Then, you should be able to log in to the server computer without entering your password.

## 6. Optimizing Remote Running ##
* Make a local edit to WhereAmI.java, and copy it to the remote server using the process you learned above. 
* You can run multiple commands in one line. Try:


    `$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls`  - List the home directory on the remote server
    
    `$ cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; 
    java WhereAmI`  - Copy the file OtherMain.java, compile and run it.
