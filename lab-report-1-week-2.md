# Lab Report 1

In Lab1 you will set up VS code and learn some basic remotely connection skills.

1. Set up VS Code

    Follow the instructoin and download VS Code from [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com).
    After installed you should see the page below when you open it.

2. Remotely Connecting

    In VS Code, open terminal and run the command:
    `$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
    
    Type yes if you get a message like this:
    `â¤‡ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
    The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?`
    
    Press enter, and then give your password. Now you successfully connect to another computer in the terminal.

3. Trying Some Commands

    Try commands in terminal. For example: 
    ls - show list
    cd - change directory 
    pwd - print working directories

4. Moving Files with `scp`
    Use the command `scp` to copy a file from your computer to a remote computer.
    Remember always run it from the client(your computer).

5. Setting an SSH Key
    Use SSH key to avoid typing the password repeatedly every time you log in. 
    First, run the command `ssh-keygen` which creates two files - public key and private key.
    
7. Optimizing Remote Running
